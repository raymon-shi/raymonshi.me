My partner and I gathered song data on 3000 Billboard Hot 100 Songs and 10,000 random songs from Spotify playlist. We extracted song features using the NLTK Sentiment Intensity Analyzer and the Spotify API in order to build a neural network that tried to predict whether a song belonged in the Billboard Hot 100 or not.
